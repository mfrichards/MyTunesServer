MyTunes Server is a PC application that lets you stream music files from your home computer to MyTunes Music Player Pro on your Android devices. With MyTunes Server and MyTunes Music Player Pro, you can use your home network as a personal cloud server for your music collection.

To use MyTunes Server, make sure your PC meets the following requirements:

Operating System: MyTunes Server runs on Windows 7 (32 or 64-bit) or greater.

Java Runtime: MyTunes Server requires the Java runtime environment (JRE), version 7.0 or greater. If you do not have the JRE installed, or use an earlier version, you should choose an installation package that includes the JRE.

Music Library: MyTunes can stream songs from your music libraries in Windows Media Player (version 11 or greater) or iTunes (version 10 or greater). Earlier versions of Windows Media Player and iTunes should work fine, however, MyTunes Server has only been tested with these versions. You can also create music libraries from file system folders.

For more information on using MyTunes Server, refer to the User's Manual in the Docs sub-folder.

Note: This is the initial release of MyTunes Server, which works with the MyTunes Pro Android app, version 1.7 or greater. As of January 2015, it is no longer being actively maintained, however, it should still work with newer versions of Windows.
